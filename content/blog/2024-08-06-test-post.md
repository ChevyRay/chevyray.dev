This post is for me to just test out all the features and styling of the blog, and to
make sure that if I change the CSS or anything I don't break any of it! This is also a
sort of light style guide for blog posts in general.

<!-- more -->

First off, this paragraph is after the `<!-- more -->` cutoff, which means that it *should not*
appear in thumbnails linking to this post from elsewhere on the site.

## Section Headers

First off, we'll test section headers (prefixed with `##` in markdown). These are the main content
separators for posts, and can be [linked to](#section-headers) directly. To link to them, the
header's text needs to be *kebab-cased*, so the above would be `#section-headers`.

### But what about sub-headers?

I usually use `###` sub-headers to ask the question I think the reader is (or should be) asking at
this point in the article. For example, if I just posted some code with an obvious error, I might
follow that up with `### Wait, won't that crash?` or something similar. Using this approach lets
me write posts in a conversational way, and helps me continually frame myself in the mind of the
reader.

### Table of Contents

Section and sub-headers can be used to generate a table of contents at the start of the page. To
enable this feature for a post, add the following to the page's frontmatter:

> toml
```toml
[extra]
has_toc = true
```

I don't like content that is nested more than 2 layers deep, so only `##` and `###` should be used
to divide things up.

## Embedding Code

This is prominently a coding blog, so code will show up a lot. First off, a monospaced text block is
denoted by wrapping the text in triple back-tick characters <code>&#x0060;&#x0060;&#x0060;</code>.

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ This text is monospaced. │
│ This                     │
│      text                │
│           is             │
│              monospaced. │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### Syntax Highlighting

If you want syntax coloring, you put the name of the programming language immediately after the ticks.
So writing this:

~~~
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
~~~

Will produce this:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Code Block Title

Sometimes it can help to give a title to a code block, either to signal the name of the "file" that
it represents. To do this, you put a single-line block quote immediately before the code block. So by prepending
the following code with `> src/main.rs`, I can produce this:

> src/main.rs
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("This code is in main.rs!");
}
```

It can also be useful to explicitly state the programming language or format being used:

> TOML
```toml
title = "Test Post"
slug = "test-post"
description = "Testing out styling and features."

[taxonomies]
tags = ["meta"]
```

## Block Quotes

I can display a quote by prepending multiple lines of text with `>` like so, which will
wrap it in a `blockquote` tag:

> "This text will appear italicized in a quote box!"

### Reader Questions

When displaying reader questions, I start the block quote with a bolded name, like so:

> **SonicFan420x69 asks:**
>
> &ldquo;What is your opinion of the inimitable video game character, Sonic the Hedgehog? Please
> answer soon as it is a matter of life or death.&rdquo;

### Cited Quotations

For when I want to have a citation, I can use the html `<cite>` tag after the quote text and it
will prepend it with a nice `—` em dash.

> "I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half
> as well as you deserve."
>
> <cite>Bilbo Baggins</cite>

### Callouts &amp; Warnings

Sometimes I want to draw the user's attention to a useful piece of information. If I start a
blockquote with an [`<i> icon`](#icons-images), it will style it as a callout. For example,
I could make a little indented to-do list by starting a quote with this:

```html
> <i class="ri-checkbox-multiple-fill"></i> **To Do**
```

Which will produce this:

> <i class="ri-checkbox-multiple-fill"></i> **To Do**
>
> - <i class="ri-checkbox-line"></i> Section Headers
> - <i class="ri-checkbox-line"></i> Syntax Highlighting
> - <i class="ri-checkbox-line"></i> Block Quotes
> - <i class="ri-checkbox-blank-line"></i> Images &amp; Icons

## Warnings

If the icon class is `ri-error-warning-line`, the callout will be colored red:

> <i class="ri-error-warning-line"></i> **Warning!**
> 
> Here is something you should be warned about! There's even a big red
> bubble here so you know it's serious. Make sure you don't miss it, or
> the consequences could be dire...

If the icon class is `ri-lightbulb-line`, then the callout will be colored blue.

> <i class="ri-lightbulb-line"></i> **Did you know?**
>
> This isn't a warning, but I wanted to draw your attention to something cool! Did you know
> I take [reader questions](/ask), and will answer them on this blog? Now you know!

These add more colors&mdash;and therefore noise&mdash;to the page and should be used sparingly.
The warning callout specifically is to alert readers to something particularly important, such
as unsafe code or something they shouldn't do.

## Icons &amp; Images

They were shown in the previous section, but icons (provided by [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/)),
can be used anywhere by inserting an `<i>` tag with the icon's class. These are useful for adding
some detail and decorating to the pages, and is another way to break up text.

### Icon Tags

For example, we could check items off a to-do list as the reader progresses in a tutorial:

- <i class="ri-checkbox-line"></i> Wake up
- <i class="ri-checkbox-line"></i> Eat breakfast
- <i class="ri-checkbox-line"></i> Finish this post
- <i class="ri-checkbox-blank-line"></i> ???
- <i class="ri-checkbox-blank-line"></i> Profit!

### Embedding Images

Images can be embedded using the usual markdown syntax:

```md
![alt text](/path/to/image.png)
```

![NOISE1 screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNTU2NDU0LzI5MTYzNzgucG5n/original/6GRlJM.png)

When there are multiple paragraphs of text in a row (usually 3-4), and nothing else to break
them up, images can be interspersed to help prevent text-wall fatique.
