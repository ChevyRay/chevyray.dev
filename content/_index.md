# The Fellowship of the Ring

When Mr. [Bilbo Baggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins) of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence with an `Option<T>` or an
[`Option::take_if`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.take_if),
there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Iterate over all integers from 4 to 10
    let mut value = 4;
    while value <= 10 {
         println!("value = {value}");
         value += 1
    }

    // Using `for` with range syntax for the same functionality
    for value in 4..=10 {
        println!("value = {value}");
    }
}
```

Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins.

At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.

## Chapter 2: Trouble Brewing

But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow up.
