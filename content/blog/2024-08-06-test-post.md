This post is for me to just test out all the features and styling of the blog, and to
make sure that if I change the CSS or anything I don't break any of it!

<!-- more -->

First off, this paragraph is after the `<!-- more -->` cutoff, which means that it *should not*
appear in thumbnails linking to this post from elsewhere on the site.

## Section Headers

First off, we'll test section headers (prefixed with `##` in markdown). These are the main content
separators for posts, and can be [linked to](#section-headers) directly. To link to them, the
header's text needs to be *kebab-cased*, so the above would be `#section-headers`.

### But what about sub-headers?

I usually use `###` sub-headers to ask the question I think the reader is (or should be) asking at
this point in the article. For example, if I just posted some code with an obvious error, I might
follow that up with `### Wait, won't that crash?` or something similar. Using this approach lets
me write posts in a conversational way, and helps me continually frame myself in the mind of the
reader.

### Table of Contents

Section and sub-headers can be used to generate a table of contents at the start of the page. To
enable this feature for a post, add the following to the page's frontmatter:

> toml
```toml

has_toc = true
